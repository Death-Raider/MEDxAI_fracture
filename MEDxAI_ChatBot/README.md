For now i have created a simple chatbot using langchain and streamlit for the ui interface
in the future will add the feature for image and pdf upload
There is also a folder called models which is necessary for it to run which i will add later
as its size is too big

firstly install all the requirements given in the requirement.txt file using the command
pip install -r requirement.txt
in the command prompt

to run the app cd to MEDxAI_Chatbot directory and run the command
streamlit run Med_chatbot.py
