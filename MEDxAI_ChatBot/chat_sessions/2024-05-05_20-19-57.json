However, it seems there may be some confusion in your question. The term \"manicular\" is not a commonly used medical term when referring to bone fractures. It's possible you meant to ask about scaphoid fractures, as these bones are part of the wrist's carpometacarpal (or manicarpo-metacarpal) joint. A scaphoid fracture is a break in one of the small bones located near the thumb side of your wrist. This injury can be quite painful and may require immobilization with a cast for several weeks to heal properly. If you have any specific concerns about this condition or if you suspect you might have a scaphoid fracture, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}]
